In this paper, we introduce a grouping approach for power allocation in the multi-user OFDM-DCSK (MU-OFDM-DCSK) system under the frequency selective fading channels. The suggested procedure is convenient also for the other comb-type non-coherent schemes with similar structure. Furthermore, we derive analytical bit error rate (BER) expression for the grouped scheme and offer an optimal power distribution policy for both the single- and multi-user scenarios. This power assignment strategy is formulated by a min–max problem with the target of the worst group BER minimization incorporating total power and interference constraints. Simulation results confirm the advantages of the proposed power allocation scheme.
